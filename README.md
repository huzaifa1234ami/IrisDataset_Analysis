### **Iris Analysis and Feature Selection**

This project provides an in-depth analysis of the Iris dataset, focusing on data preprocessing, feature selection, and exploring methods to identify the most important features. The notebook demonstrates the application of various statistical and machine learning techniques to gain insights into the dataset.

---

## **Overview**

The notebook contains the following key steps:

1. **Data Import**:  
   The Iris dataset is read from an Excel file using pandas.

2. **Data Cleaning**:  
   - Identification of null values across columns.  
   - Null values are handled by replacing them with the mean of the respective columns.

3. **Feature Selection**:  
   - Application of different methods to identify important features in the dataset.  
   - Methods include statistical techniques and machine learning-based approaches.

4. **Analysis**:  
   - Various visualizations and computations are performed to analyze the relationships between features.  
   - Feature importance is determined to improve the interpretability of the dataset.
